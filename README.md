# Capstone-Project
A Fulltstack Expense/Savings management tool

About the app:

This application allows users to record, edit, delete, and view their expenses and saving. This application was created for people who have trouble organizing all their financial expenses and savings and to hopefully make better financial decisions. The front end uses React.js with CSS styling along with bootstrap/reactstrap. The back end is handled by Java, Springboot, and the MySQL.

Application should implement all CRUD operations, utilizing Entities, Controller classes, and Interfaces

Establish a connection with your React project as a View layer that includes Components for CRUD operations

For a responsive app, install Bootstrap, or use Media Queries, or any other responsive plugins of your choice

Access your RESTful API from your React project using axios (http library) and display in a formatted view (CSS)

Add Router functionality in your React project

Uses MySql as a SQL database

Uses Spring Tool Suite (STS) for Spring Boot application w/Maven as a build tool

Uses Apache Tomcat as a web server

You will push your back-end and front-end (full-stack application) into one repository. 

Commits to GitHub every day

A README file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc. It should clearly document the purpose of the project as a problem statement, and the target end user for this program.
